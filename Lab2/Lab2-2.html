		<h2>Information about Sports and Health</h2>
		<p id="intro"><strong>Building a Healthy and Balanced Diet</strong></p>
		<p ><strong class="title">Make most of your meal vegetables and fruits – ½ of your plate.</strong><br>
		Aim for color and variety, and remember that potatoes don’t count as vegetables on the Healthy Eating Plate because of their negative impact on blood sugar.</p>
		<div>
			<p ><strong class="title">Go for whole grains – ¼ of your plate.</strong><br>
			Whole and intact grains—whole wheat, barley, wheat berries, quinoa, oats, brown rice, and foods made with them, such as whole wheat pasta—have a milder effect on blood sugar and insulin than white bread, white rice, and other refined grains.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<p><strong class="title">Protein power – ¼ of your plate.</strong><br>
			Fish, poultry, beans, and nuts are all healthy, versatile protein sources—they can be mixed into salads, and pair well with vegetables on a plate. Limit red meat, and avoid processed meats such as bacon and sausage.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<p><strong class="title">Healthy plant oils – in moderation.</strong><br>
			Choose healthy vegetable oils like olive, canola, soy, corn, sunflower, peanut, and others, and avoid partially hydrogenated oils, which contain unhealthy trans fats. Remember that low-fat does not mean “healthy.”</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<p><strong class="title">Drink water, coffee, or tea.</strong><br>
			Skip sugary drinks, limit milk and dairy products to one to two servings per day, and limit juice to a small glass per day.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<p><strong class="title">Stay active.</strong><br>
			The red figure running across the Healthy Eating Plate’s placemat is a reminder that staying active is also important in weight control.</p>
